## What and why

:wave:Hello!  

Here you will find all of the code that I have written while taking the "Scientific Computing with Python" course on CodeCamp and also the certification projects that I am currently working on. <br/> I have sorted out my code by specific topics, which you can easily access through the contents section.

:electron: Hope you will find it helpful or interesting!

ℹ️About the course "Scientific Computing with Python" (Python for everybody) 


It is a free video course series that teaches the basics of using Python 3. The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and web development.
